I used to code in VSCode but I discovered neovim and immediately fell in love. VSCode is a such a good editor, but I felt something was not right, because when I installed some plugins, VSCode was very slow

I'm trying to set up my neovim editor like an editor very powerfull, something like VSCode.

I'm using
[packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

Themes support with tree-sitter syntax hightlighting:
