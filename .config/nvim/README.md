# This is my nvim config

## Coc Plugs

Make sure you have installed COC

```shell
:CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-json coc-pairse coc-snippets coc-eslint coc-prettier coc-go
```

## My Vim keybindings

My leader key is the space key.

- <Ctl + b> or <leader + b> --> open the file explorer (like in Vscode)
- <Ctl + f> or <leader + ff> --> open the telescope to find files
- <leader + fb> --> open the current files open

## Native Vim keyding

I recommend you learn and practice these keybindings, it'll make your coding easier
