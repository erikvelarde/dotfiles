# This is my nvim config

## Coc Plugs

Make sure you have installed COC

```shell
:CocInstall coc-tsserver coc-json coc-pairse coc-snippets coc-eslint coc-prettier coc-go
```

## My Vim keybindings

My leader key is the space key.

- <Ctl + b> or <leader + b> --> open the file explorer (like in Vscode)
- <Ctl + f> or <leader + ff> --> open the telescope to find files
- <leader + fb> --> open the current files open

## Native Vim keyding

I recommend you learn and practice these keybindings, it'll make your coding easier

In normal mode:

- <c + i + }> --> to remove everything between two curly braces like: { "hello" } => {}
- <c + i + ]> --> to remove everything between two square braces like: [9, 8, "fred"] => []
- <c + i + "> --> to remove everything between two double quotes like: "Learn about vim" => ""
- <c + i + w> --> to remove a single word
